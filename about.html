			<h1>About IdaPHP</h1>
			<div style="color:red">*work in progress*</div>
			<h3>The Original Project</h3>
			<p>
				IdaPHP is a direct port of a CS222 class project at Ball State called Ida4D2.
				The project was worked on by Clinton Evans, John Godsey, and Matthew Bennett in the Fall of 2012.
			</p>
			<h3>The Inner Workings</h3>
			<p>Ida4D2 operated using a keyword based tactic that involves breaking the user input into chunks and pulling from an XML document all entries containing those keywords.
			By calculating weights on each keyword Ida pulled the best (to her) response.  It was possible to teach her by modifying these weights.</p>
			
			<h3>IdaPHP</h3>
			<p>Ida4D2 (and her child ARTIE) is written in Java using XML as her primary database.  IdaPHP as her name suggests is a PHP conversion and simplification of the original code
			that uses a MySQL database which allows her to converse with multiple people at once.</p>
			
			IdaPHP is open source and hosted here: <a href="https://github.com/jaeg/IdaPHP">https://github.com/jaeg/IdaPHP</a>
